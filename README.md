# Python Gifer

Take a sample data set from the app crawl and put it in here and rename the folder `res`. Before you try running the script, create the `gifs/` folder in main directory. Then run:

`python main.py`

## Notes

The unix limit on open files is 256 so currently, gifs that have more than 256 frames are not supported.
